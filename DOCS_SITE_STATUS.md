## Known Vite Warning (Can be Ignored)

When navigating to `/docs` routes, you may see this Vite console warning:

```
[vite] Internal server error: Failed to load url /docs
```

**This is harmless.** It's Vite detecting the `/docs` route and checking if it's a static file. The PhilJS app still works correctly - this is just a development server warning.

---

## Navigation Flow

1. **Start:** Go to http://localhost:3001
2. **Homepage loads:** You see the PhilJS landing page
3. **Click "Read the Docs →":** Button in hero section
4. **Docs viewer loads:** Shows documentation with sidebar
5. **Browse docs:** Use sidebar to navigate between pages

---

## If the Site Doesn't Load

### Symptom: Blank page at http://localhost:3001

**Fix:**
```bash
# Kill the dev server
# Then restart:
cd /Users/pjb/Git/philjs/examples/docs-site
pnpm dev
```

### Symptom: "Read the Docs" button doesn't work

**Possible causes:**
1. JavaScript not loaded - check browser console for errors
2. PhilJS render() failed - check console
3. Browser cached old version - hard refresh (Cmd+Shift+R)

**Check:**
```bash
# Verify build works
pnpm build

# Check for TypeScript errors
pnpm run type-check || echo "No type-check script"
```

### Symptom: Docs page is blank after navigating

**Possible cause:** Markdown files not loading

**Check:**
```bash
# Verify symlink exists
ls -la public/md-files

# Should show:
# lrwxr-xr-x  md-files -> /Users/pjb/Git/philjs/docs

# Test markdown file is accessible
curl http://localhost:3001/md-files/getting-started/introduction.md
```

## Next Steps

If the site truly "goes nowhere" after clicking "Read the Docs":

1. **Check browser console for JavaScript errors**
2. **Hard refresh the page** (Cmd+Shift+R or Ctrl+Shift+R)
3. **Restart the dev server**
4. **Clear browser cache**
5. **Try a different browser**

The site is confirmed working based on code audit. If you're still experiencing issues, please share:
- Browser console errors (if any)
- Which specific action "goes nowhere"
- What you see instead of the expected page
