## RISK MITIGATION

### Risk: Bundle Size Too Hard to Hit
**Mitigation:**
- Measure early (Week 1)
- Set realistic targets (12KB → 10KB)
- Make features truly optional

**Plan B:** Ship at 12KB, optimize in v2.1

### Risk: Compiler Instability
**Mitigation:**
- Test on real apps (Week 5)
- Conservative optimizations
- Make compiler optional

**Plan B:** Ship with basic optimizations only

### Risk: PPR/Islands Not Ready
**Mitigation:**
- Test in production early (Month 4)
- Start with conservative defaults
- Extensive documentation

**Plan B:** Mark as experimental, stable in v2.1

### Risk: Team Burnout
**Mitigation:**
- Cut scope ruthlessly
- Celebrate small wins
- Take breaks

**Plan B:** Extend timeline to 18 months

## MARKET POSITIONING

### What We Compete On:
1. ✅ Fine-grained reactivity (match Solid)
2. ✅ Auto-accessibility (UNIQUE)
3. ✅ Built-in A/B testing (UNIQUE)
4. ✅ Excellent DX (TypeScript, docs)
5. ✅ Small bundle (≤10KB)

### What We Accept:
- ❌ Smaller ecosystem than React (obvious)
- ❌ Newer than Vue/Angular (expected)
- ❌ Fewer jobs than React (reality)
- ❌ Won't beat Qwik on Lighthouse (fine)

### Marketing Messages:
- "The accessible-by-default framework"
- "10KB bundle, infinite possibilities"
- "Fine-grained reactivity meets great DX"
- "Built-in A/B testing for data-driven apps"

---

## WHAT NOT TO BUILD

### ❌ Cut Entirely:
1. Rust/SWC compiler (Babel is good enough)
2. Million.js integration (experimental, risky)
3. Multi-platform renderers (web-first)
4. Atomic CSS compiler (use UnoCSS)
5. Web Components output (niche)
6. 4-tier adaptive hydration (over-engineered)
7. Cell pattern (too opinionated)
8. DI container (use existing libs)

### ⏸️ Defer to v2.1+:
1. Type-safe CSS (cool but not critical)
2. Advanced DevTools (basic first)
3. AI component generation (experimental)
4. Alpine.js fallback (SSR covers it)

## DECISION FRAMEWORK

When evaluating any feature request:

```
IF helps ship v2.0 faster THEN
  Consider it
ELSE IF closes competitive gap THEN
  High priority
ELSE IF high impact + low effort THEN
  Do it
ELSE IF low impact OR high effort THEN
  Defer to v2.1+ or cut
ELSE
  Ask: "Can users accomplish this another way?"
  IF yes THEN cut
  ELSE defer
END
```

## THE PATH FORWARD

### Now (Week 1)
Start measuring everything. Establish honest baseline.

### Next 2 Weeks
Ship quick wins. Build momentum.

### Next 3 Months
Ship v2.0-beta. Validate in production.

### Next 6 Months
Ship v2.0 stable. Establish market position.

### Next 12 Months
Ship v2.1. Plan v3.0. Grow community.

---

## WHEN TO DECLARE VICTORY

Not when you have every feature.
Not when you beat React.
Not when you're #1 on Hacker News.

**When developers say:**

> "PhilJS just works. The docs are great. The bundle is tiny. And my app is accessible by default. I'm sold."

---

## THE HONEST TIMELINE

- **End Month 2:** v2.0-alpha (proven core)
- **End Month 3:** v2.0-beta (production-validated)
- **End Month 6:** v2.0-stable (battle-tested)
- **End Month 12:** v2.1 (advanced features)
- **Month 18+:** v3.0 planning (maybe Rust?)

---

## FINAL WORD

The RFC recommendations are AMBITIOUS. They represent a vision of what PhilJS could become with unlimited resources.

But we don't have unlimited resources. We have 2 developers and 6 months.

So we make hard choices:
- ✅ Keep what makes PhilJS unique
- ✅ Ship what's proven to work
- ✅ Cut what's experimental or risky
- ✅ Focus on core value, not feature parity

**Perfect is the enemy of shipped.**

Let's ship v2.0.
