2. **Coverage Gap**
   - Current: ~75%
   - Target: 90%
   - **Gap:** 15 percentage points
   - **Impact:** Medium - Still good coverage

3. **E2E Tests**
   - Playwright configured but not executed
   - Requires browser environment
   - **Impact:** Low - Integration tests provide coverage

### Recommendations

1. **Short Term (1-2 weeks)**
   - Execute Playwright E2E tests in real browser
   - Run performance benchmarks
   - Increase coverage to 85%+

2. **Medium Term (1 month)**
   - Add visual regression testing
   - Set up continuous deployment
   - Add A11y automated testing

3. **Long Term (3 months)**
   - Production monitoring dashboard
   - Advanced performance profiling
   - Community contribution guidelines
