**🎉 Beta Release - Ready for brave early adopters!**

> **Status**: Core features production-ready • 110 pages of documentation • 9 packages built successfully

## ✨ Novel Features

PhilJS is the **only framework** with these intelligence capabilities:

### 1. **Intent-Based Smart Preloading** 🎯
Predicts user navigation from mouse movement with 60-80% accuracy.

### 2. **Production Usage Analytics** 📊
Tracks which components/props are used in production. Finds dead code with confidence.

### 3. **Cloud Cost Tracking** 💰
Estimates AWS/GCP/Azure costs per route. See costs in IDE tooltips.

### 4. **Performance Budgets That Block Builds** ⚠️
Hard limits on bundle size, LCP, CLS. Build fails if exceeded.

### 5. **Time-Travel Debugging with Branching** ⏱️
Explore "what if" scenarios. Export sessions for bug reports.

### 6. **Mixed Rendering Modes** 🔄
SSG, ISR, SSR, CSR - all in one app, per-route configuration.

## 🏗️ Core Features

- ⚡ **Fine-Grained Reactivity** - Signals with automatic dependency tracking
- 🏝️ **Islands Architecture** - Selective hydration for minimal JavaScript
- 🔄 **Zero-Hydration Resumability** - Serialize state on server, resume on client
- 📝 **Progressive Form Validation** - Schema-based validation that works without JS

- **[Getting Started](./docs/getting-started/introduction.md)** - Introduction, installation, quickstart
- **[Core Concepts](./docs/core-concepts/overview.md)** - Signals, memos, effects, components
- **[API Reference](./docs/api-reference/overview.md)** - Complete API documentation
- **[Best Practices](./docs/best-practices/overview.md)** - Production guidelines
- **[Migration Guides](./docs/migration/)** - Migrate from React, Vue, or Svelte

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Create a new app
pnpm create philjs my-app

# Navigate and install
cd my-app
pnpm install

# Start dev server
pnpm dev
```

**Your first component:**

```tsx
import { signal } from 'philjs-core';

function Counter() {
  const count = signal(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {count()}</p>
      <button onClick={() => count.set(count() + 1)}>
        Increment
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

**That's it!** No useState, no dependency arrays, just pure reactivity. ✨

## Development

```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Build all packages
pnpm build

# Run tests
pnpm test

# Lint and typecheck
pnpm lint
pnpm typecheck

# Run storefront example
pnpm dev
```

## Examples

- `examples/storefront`: Full-featured e-commerce demo with loaders, actions, islands, and AI
- `examples/docs-site`: Documentation site (coming soon)

## Architecture

PhilJS combines the best patterns from modern web frameworks:

1. **Signals for reactivity**: Inspired by SolidJS, signals provide fine-grained updates
2. **Islands for performance**: Inspired by Astro, ship only the JS you need
3. **Resumability**: Inspired by Qwik, minimize client-side hydration
4. **File-based routing**: Inspired by Next.js and Remix, convention over configuration
5. **AI-first**: Built-in support for AI features with safety defaults

## Tech Stack

- Node 18+
- PNPM workspaces
- Vite for development
- Rollup for production builds
- Vitest for unit tests
- Playwright for E2E tests
- TypeScript (optional, can use JS with JSDoc)

## Performance

PhilJS is designed for speed:

- Islands architecture minimizes JavaScript
- SSR streaming improves perceived performance
- Resumability reduces hydration cost
- Built-in performance budgets and HTTP early hints enforce limits
- RUM tracks real-world metrics

## Security

Security is a priority:

- CSP helpers with strict defaults
- Auto-escape HTML in templates
- Cookie helpers with SameSite, Secure, and rotation secrets
- Signed cookies and nonced scripts enabled via `buildCSP`, `createCookie`, and `createNonce`
- ESLint security plugin
- AI PII detection hooks
