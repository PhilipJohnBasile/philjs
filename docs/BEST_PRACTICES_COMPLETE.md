## Topics Covered

### Component Patterns
- Presentational vs Container components
- Composition patterns (children, render props, compound)
- Props patterns (optional, discriminated unions, polymorphic)
- Error handling with boundaries
- Loading states and Suspense
- Form patterns
- List rendering with keys

### State Management
- Local vs lifted vs global state
- Store patterns (simple, factory, async, persistent)
- State composition
- State machines
- Optimistic updates
- Undo/redo functionality
- Performance optimization with batching

### Performance
- Fine-grained reactivity advantages
- Memoization strategies
- Batching updates
- Code splitting with lazy()
- List virtualization
- Debouncing and throttling
- Image optimization
- Web Workers
- Memory management

### Testing
- Test pyramid (70% unit, 20% integration, 10% E2E)
- Testing signals, memos, effects
- Component testing
- Integration testing with context/router
- E2E testing with Playwright
- Arrange-Act-Assert pattern
- Coverage goals

### Code Organization
- Standard vs feature-based structure
- File naming conventions
- Component organization
- Store organization
- Import order and path aliases
- Type organization
- Service organization
- Environment variables

### Architecture
- Layered architecture (Presentation, Application, Service, Infrastructure)
- Dependency injection with Context
- Plugin architecture
- Module federation for micro-frontends
- Event-driven architecture with event bus
- CQRS pattern
- Hexagonal architecture (Ports & Adapters)

### Security
- XSS prevention
- CSRF protection
- Authentication and token storage
- Authorization (RBAC, route guards)
- Input validation (client + server)
- SQL injection prevention
- Secrets management
- Content Security Policy
- Rate limiting
- File upload security

### Accessibility
- Semantic HTML elements
- ARIA attributes (labels, roles, states)
- Keyboard navigation and focus management
- Screen reader support
- Color contrast and visual design
- Accessible forms
- Image alt text
- Responsive design
- Touch targets
- Testing accessibility

### Production
- Build optimization (code splitting, minification)
- Environment configuration
- Error tracking with Sentry
- Analytics integration
- Performance monitoring (Web Vitals)
- Structured logging
- Caching strategies (Service Worker)
- Health checks
- CI/CD pipelines
- Docker deployment
- Security headers
- Monitoring and alerting

## Key Best Practices Highlighted

### General Principles
✅ Explicit over implicit
✅ Immutability for signals
✅ Composition over complexity
✅ Type safety with TypeScript
✅ Performance by default

### Component Design
✅ Separate presentational and container components
✅ Use composition patterns
✅ Design clear, type-safe props
✅ Handle errors gracefully
✅ Provide loading states

### State Management
✅ Keep state as local as possible
✅ Use stores for truly global state
✅ Compose stores instead of monoliths
✅ Implement optimistic updates for better UX
✅ Batch related updates

### Performance
✅ Leverage fine-grained reactivity
✅ Use memo() for expensive computations
✅ Implement code splitting
✅ Virtualize long lists
✅ Clean up effects properly

### Testing
✅ Write behavior tests, not implementation tests
✅ Follow test pyramid
✅ Mock external dependencies
✅ Test error states and edge cases
✅ Maintain good coverage

### Security
✅ Sanitize all user input
✅ Use CSRF tokens
✅ Store tokens securely
✅ Validate on client AND server
✅ Never commit secrets
✅ Implement RBAC
✅ Use security headers

### Accessibility
✅ Use semantic HTML
✅ Add ARIA where needed
✅ Ensure keyboard navigation
✅ Maintain visible focus
✅ Provide sufficient contrast
✅ Test with screen readers

### Production
✅ Optimize build with code splitting
✅ Configure environment properly
✅ Integrate error tracking
✅ Monitor performance
✅ Set up CI/CD
✅ Use security headers
✅ Plan zero-downtime deployments
