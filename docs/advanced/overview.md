## Overview

This section covers advanced topics that help you build production-ready applications with PhilJS. These topics go beyond the fundamentals and explore patterns used in real-world applications.

## Topics Covered

### Rendering Strategies

**Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**
- Render pages on the server for better SEO and initial load performance
- Stream HTML to the client as it's generated
- Handle hydration for interactive components
- Balance server and client rendering

**Static Site Generation (SSG)**
- Pre-render pages at build time
- Serve static HTML for maximum performance
- Incremental static regeneration (ISR)
- Hybrid rendering strategies

### Internationalization

**i18n Support**
- Multi-language applications
- Translation management
- Locale-specific formatting
- Right-to-left (RTL) support
- Dynamic locale switching

### Authentication & Authorization

**Security Patterns**
- Authentication strategies (JWT, session-based, OAuth)
- Protected routes
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Permission systems
- Secure token management

### State Management

**Advanced State Patterns**
- Global state management
- State machines
- Complex state synchronization
- Persistence strategies
- Undo/redo functionality

### Real-Time Features

**Live Data**
- WebSocket integration
- Server-sent events (SSE)
- Real-time updates
- Optimistic updates
- Conflict resolution

### Progressive Web Apps

**Offline Support**
- Service workers
- Caching strategies
- Offline functionality
- Background sync
- Push notifications

### Testing

**Comprehensive Testing**
- Unit testing components
- Integration testing
- End-to-end testing
- Testing reactive state
- Mocking and fixtures

### Error Handling

**Robust Applications**
- Error boundaries
- Global error handling
- Error reporting
- Recovery strategies
- Fallback UI

### Advanced Patterns

**Expert Techniques**
- Portals for rendering outside DOM hierarchy
- Suspense for async rendering
- Custom hooks and utilities
- Performance optimization patterns
- Architectural patterns

## Who Should Read This

This section is for developers who:

- Have completed the fundamentals and core concepts
- Are building production applications
- Need advanced patterns for complex requirements
- Want to implement best practices for scalability
- Are optimizing for performance and user experience

## Prerequisites

Before diving into advanced topics, you should be comfortable with:

- PhilJS fundamentals (signals, effects, memos)
- Component patterns
- Routing and navigation
- Data fetching
- Forms and validation
- Basic performance optimization

## Learning Path

We recommend following this order:

1. **Start with rendering strategies** (SSR, SSG) to understand how PhilJS renders content
2. **Move to i18n** if building multi-language applications
3. **Implement authentication** for secure applications
4. **Explore state management** for complex state needs
5. **Add real-time features** if needed
6. **Implement service workers** for offline support
7. **Set up testing** throughout development
8. **Add error handling** for robustness
9. **Apply advanced patterns** as needed

## Code Examples

All pages include production-ready TypeScript examples that you can use directly in your applications. Examples demonstrate:

- Real-world use cases
- Type-safe implementations
- Performance considerations
- Best practices
- Common pitfalls to avoid
