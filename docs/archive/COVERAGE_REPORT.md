## Coverage Quality Issues

### False Positives
- Some lines marked as covered may not test all edge cases
- Async code paths may have race conditions
- Error handlers covered but not all error types

### Coverage Blind Spots
- TypeScript type checking not validated
- Runtime type validation minimal
- Memory leaks not detected by coverage
- Performance regressions not detected
- Security vulnerabilities not tested

## Coverage Enforcement

### Current State
- No coverage thresholds configured
- No pre-commit coverage checks
- No CI coverage gates
- No coverage reports in PR reviews

### Recommended Configuration

```javascript
// vitest.config.ts
export default {
  test: {
    coverage: {
      provider: 'v8',
      reporter: ['text', 'json', 'html', 'lcov'],
      lines: 80,
      functions: 80,
      branches: 75,
      statements: 80,
      exclude: [
        'node_modules/',
        'dist/',
        '**/*.test.ts',
        '**/*.config.ts',
      ],
      thresholds: {
        perFile: true,
        autoUpdate: false,
        lines: 80,
        functions: 80,
        branches: 75,
        statements: 80,
      },
    },
  },

- Performance tests
- Visual regression tests
- Coverage enforcement
- Documentation

**Expected Coverage:**
- Overall: 82%
- All packages: 75%+ minimum

## Coverage vs. Quality

High coverage doesn't guarantee quality. We must also ensure:

1. **Test Quality**
   - Tests actually validate behavior
   - Edge cases are tested
   - Error cases are tested
   - Integration points are tested

2. **Test Reliability**
   - No flaky tests
   - Fast execution
   - Clear failure messages
   - Reproducible failures

3. **Test Maintainability**
   - Well-organized
   - Clear naming
   - Minimal duplication
   - Easy to update

## Conclusion

PhilJS currently has **~15% test coverage**, which is **far below** the industry standard of 80% for production frameworks.

**Critical issues:**
- 0% coverage for router (core feature)
- 0% coverage for SSR (core feature)
- 0% coverage for data layer (core feature)
- 0% coverage for novel features (AI, cost tracking, analytics)
- Memory leak preventing signals testing

**Path forward:**
1. Fix memory leak (1-2 days)
2. Add router + SSR + data layer tests (Week 1)
3. Add context + AI + cost tracking tests (Week 2)
4. Add integration + E2E tests (Week 3)
5. Achieve 80% coverage (Week 4)

**Timeline to 80% coverage:** 4 weeks with dedicated focus

The framework **cannot be recommended for production use** until coverage reaches at least 70% with all core features tested.
