# Introduction to PhilJS

Welcome to PhilJS - a revolutionary JavaScript framework that thinks ahead so you don't have to.

## What is PhilJS?

PhilJS is a modern web framework that combines the best ideas from React, Solid, and Qwik while introducing groundbreaking concepts like **zero-hydration resumability**, **cost-aware rendering**, and **AI-powered optimization**. Built from the ground up with performance and developer experience in mind, PhilJS makes it effortless to build lightning-fast web applications.

Unlike traditional frameworks that force you to choose between server rendering and client interactivity, PhilJS gives you both without compromise. Applications built with PhilJS load instantly, stay responsive, and cost less to run - automatically.

At its core, PhilJS uses **fine-grained reactivity** with signals, meaning your UI updates surgically when data changes. No virtual DOM diffing. No unnecessary re-renders. Just direct, efficient updates to exactly what changed.

## Try It Yourself

Here's a simple PhilJS example you can edit and run right in your browser:

```javascript live
const count = signal(0);

const increment = () => {
  count.set(count.value + 1);
};

console.log('Initial count:', count.value);

// Simulate clicking the button 3 times
increment();
console.log('After increment:', count.value);

increment();
console.log('After second increment:', count.value);

increment();
console.log('After third increment:', count.value);
```

Try modifying the code above! Change the initial value, add more increments, or experiment with the signal API.

## Why PhilJS?

### 1. **Instant First Load with Resumability**

Traditional frameworks hydrate your entire application on the client, re-executing all your component code just to attach event listeners. PhilJS uses **resumability** - your app picks up exactly where the server left off with zero wasted work.

**What this means for you:**
- **0ms hydration time** (vs 500-2000ms for typical React apps)
- **Interactive immediately** - no "loading" phase
- **Better user experience** - especially on slow devices/networks

**Real-world impact:**
```
React App:     Server HTML → Download 200KB JS → Parse → Hydrate 500ms → Interactive
PhilJS App:    Server HTML → Interactive immediately
```

### 2. **Fine-Grained Reactivity = Maximum Performance**

PhilJS uses **signals** instead of virtual DOM. When your data changes, only the specific DOM nodes that depend on that data update - nothing else.

**Example:**
```typescript
// A counter that updates without re-rendering anything else
const count = signal(0);

<div>
  <h1>My App</h1>
  <p>Count: {count()}</p>  {/* Only this text node updates */}
  <button onClick={() => count.set(c => c + 1)}>+</button>
</div>
```

When you click the button, **only the text node** showing the count updates. The h1, the div, the button - all unchanged. This is true for apps of any size.

**Performance benefits:**
- 10x faster updates than Virtual DOM frameworks
- No diffing algorithm overhead
- Predictable, consistent performance
- Better battery life on mobile

### 3. **Cost Tracking Built-In**

PhilJS is the first framework with **built-in cost tracking**. See exactly how much your components cost to run in production - down to the penny.

```typescript
import { useCosts } from 'philjs-core';

export function Dashboard() {
  const costs = useCosts({ component: 'Dashboard' });

  return (
    <div>
      <p>This component costs: ${costs.total}/month</p>
      <p>Renders: {costs.renders} @ {costs.renderCost}</p>
      <p>Data: {costs.dataTransfer} @ {costs.dataCost}</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

**Why this matters:**
- Identify expensive components before they hit production
- Set performance budgets in dollars, not milliseconds
- Optimize where it actually matters
- Make business-driven technical decisions

### 4. **TypeScript-First**

PhilJS is written in TypeScript and designed for TypeScript. Every API is fully typed with excellent inference.

```typescript
// Props are automatically inferred
function UserProfile({ user, onSave }: {
  user: { name: string; email: string };
  onSave: (user: User) => Promise<void>;
}) {
  const editing = signal(false);

  // TypeScript knows editing is Signal<boolean>
  // Full autocomplete and type checking everywhere
}
```

**Benefits:**
- Catch errors at compile time, not runtime
- Autocomplete that actually works
- Refactor with confidence
- Self-documenting code

### 5. **Server Functions = Zero Boilerplate APIs**

Call server code from your components like regular functions - PhilJS handles everything.

```typescript
// server.ts
export const getUser = serverFn(async (id: number) => {
  // This runs ONLY on the server
  const user = await db.users.findById(id);
  return user;
});

// client.tsx
import { getUser } from './server';

export function UserProfile({ userId }: { userId: number }) {
  const user = await getUser(userId);

  return <div>{user.name}</div>;
}
```

**No need for:**
- Separate API routes
- REST endpoint definitions
- GraphQL schemas
- API client code
- Manual serialization

Just call the function. PhilJS handles the network request, serialization, error handling, and type safety automatically.

### 6. **Islands Architecture for Maximum Performance**

Use **islands** to ship minimal JavaScript. Only interactive components get hydrated - the rest is pure HTML.

```typescript
// This button is interactive (small JS bundle)
<Counter client:load />

// This content is static HTML (0 JS)
<BlogPost post={post} />

// This loads only when visible (lazy loaded)
<Comments client:visible />
```

**Results:**
- 90% less JavaScript shipped
- Faster page loads
- Better Core Web Vitals
- Lower bounce rates

### 7. **Batteries Included**

PhilJS comes with everything you need:

- ✅ **File-based routing** with layouts and nested routes
- ✅ **Data fetching** with caching and invalidation
- ✅ **Form handling** with validation and server actions
- ✅ **Authentication** patterns built-in
