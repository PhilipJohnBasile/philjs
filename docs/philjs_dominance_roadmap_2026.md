## 📅 Q1 2026: Core Performance & Technical Supremacy
*Focus: Locking down the fundamentals so we are famously faster and better than the incumbents.*

### 🚀 Runtime & Performance
- [ ] **React 19 Parity**: Ensure PhilJS Compiler optimizations match React Compiler logic 1:1.
- [x] **Preact Benchmark**: Beat Preact Signals performance in the "10k rows" challenge. (Package created)
- [x] **Rust-to-JS Ergonomics**: Simplify the bindgen layer for easier user-land Rust modules. (Implemented @philjs/rust-bridge)
- [ ] **Cold Start**: Benchmark and optimize Cloudflare Worker start times to <5ms (beat Hono/Fresh).
- [x] **Alpine Mode**: Maintain strict "CDN-only" distribution for drop-in usage. (Implemented @philjs/alpine)

### 🛠️ Framework Parity
- [x] **HTMX**: Maintain 1:1 attribute compatibility with latest HTMX release. (Implemented)
- [x] **Lit/WC**: Push boundaries of "Declarative Shadow DOM" support in SSR. (Implemented)
- [ ] **SolidJS**: Maintain strict parity with Solid's fine-grained reactivity updates.
- [ ] **Astro**: Benchmark static build times for 10k page sites against Astro.

### ⚡ Build Tooling
- [ ] **Vite**: Stay on bleeding-edge Vite releases (Day 0 support).
- [ ] **Atomic CSS**: Benchmark build times for large Panda/UnoCSS projects.
- [ ] **pnpm**: Enforce/Optimize pnpm usage for large monorepo speed.

## 📅 Q2 2026: Enterprise & Full-Stack Adoption
*Focus: Removing barriers for big teams migrating from Legacy or heavy-duty backends.*

### 🏢 Enterprise Migration
- [x] **Angular**: Enhance `@philjs/di` to capture enterprise Angular teams. (Implemented InjectionToken/Optional)
- [ ] **Backbone/Ember**: Release "AI Migrator" specifically trained on legacy MVC patterns.
- [ ] **Java/Spring**: Improve Maven/Gradle plugin integration for "Backend-for-Frontend" workflow.
- [ ] **C#/.NET**: Add seamless SignalR integration to `@philjs/dotnet`.
- [ ] **AdonisJS**: Support the IoC Container pattern natively.

### 📦 Stacks & Starters
- [x] **P-Stack**: Release CLI preset for (PhilJS + tRPC + Tailwind + Prisma) to compete with T3. (Template added to create-philjs)
- [ ] **MEAN/MERN**: Release "One-Command" setup scripts for Mongo/Node stacks.
- [ ] **Sails/Rails**: Create "Blueprints" rapid-prototyping generators.

### 🧪 Data & Reliability
- [ ] **TanStack Query**: Ensure "Optimistic Updates" API is as intuitive as TanStack.
- [ ] **Relay**: Improve documentation for fragment co-location without compilation complex.
- [ ] **Validation**: Ensure Zod/Valibot error messages are i18n-ready out of the box.

## 📅 Q3 2026: The AI & Agent Frontier
*Focus: Leveraging our unique AI-native architecture to do things no other framework can.*

### 🤖 Agents & LLMs
- [x] **Hierarchical Teams**: Deepen support for complex "Manager -> Worker" agent flows in `@philjs/ai-agents`. (Implemented HierarchicalTeam)
- [ ] **Visual Graph Editor**: Release a GUI for designing LangGraph/PhilJS agent flows.
- [ ] **RAG**: Optimize vector retrieval speeds in `@philjs/vector-store`.
- [ ] **Edge Agents**: Keep the `smolagents` runtime under 5KB for edge deployment.

### 🧠 Testing & Healing
- [x] **Self-Healing Tests**: Add AI-healing to Playwright selectors (auto-fix broken tests). (Implemented @philjs/self-healing)
- [ ] **Context Awareness**: Simplify "useCopilot" hooks to feed app state to LLMs.
- [ ] **Observability**: Add specific "Cost per Token" dashboards to the dev console.

## 📅 Q4 2026: Deep Ecosystem & Platform Expansion
*Focus: Extending PhilJS beyond the browser into IDEs, Mobile, and Desktop.*

### 📱 Mobile & Native
- [ ] **React Native**: Improve "Universal Navigation" patterns to share logic 100% with web.
- [ ] **Ionic**: Ensure iOS transition animations are perfectly smooth (60fps guaranteed).
- [ ] **Tauri**: Support Tauri Mobile build targets in the CLI.

### 💻 Developer Experience (IDE)
- [ ] **Refactoring**: Add "Move Component" refactoring actions to VS Code/WebStorm plugins.
- [ ] **Open in GitHub**: Add specific "Open in GitHub" context menu for components.
- [ ] **Documentation**: Add enhanced MDX features for interactive documentation.

### ☁️ Cloud & Edge
- [ ] **Durable Objects**: Support stateful serverless patterns (Cloudflare Durable Objects) natively.
- [ ] **Containerization**: Optimize default Docker image size to target <50MB.
