# Recipes

Task-focused guides for common PhilJS patterns. Each recipe is under 300 words with copyable code and a clear outcome.

## Data Fetching

### [Fetch Data on Mount](/docs/recipes/fetch-data-on-mount)
Load data from an API when a component first renders. Covers loading states, error handling, and automatic dependency tracking.

### [Debounce Search Input](/docs/recipes/debounce-search-input)
Delay API calls while user types to reduce requests. Perfect for search bars, autocomplete, and live validation.

### [Infinite Scroll](/docs/recipes/infinite-scroll)
Load more items automatically as user scrolls to bottom. Uses Intersection Observer for efficient scroll detection.

## Forms

### [Form with Validation](/docs/recipes/form-with-validation)
Validate form fields and show errors before submission. Includes accessibility attributes and client-side validation patterns.

## UI Patterns

### [Dark Mode Toggle](/docs/recipes/dark-mode-toggle)
Persist user's theme preference and apply it instantly. Respects system preference and provides smooth transitions.
