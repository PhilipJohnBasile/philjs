# Introduction

Welcome to The PhilJS Rust Book. This guide shows how to build modern web applications with Rust and PhilJS.

## Why Rust for Web?

Rust brings real advantages to UI development:

- Performance: near-native speed with WebAssembly
- Type safety: compile-time guarantees
- Memory safety: no null pointer exceptions or data races
- Portability: the same code runs in the browser and on the server

## Why PhilJS?

PhilJS pairs Rust ergonomics with a signals-first UI model:

- Fine-grained reactivity with signals, memos, and effects
- RSX syntax with the view! macro
- SSR, hydration, and streaming APIs
- Integration with TypeScript-based tooling and dev servers

## What You Will Learn

1. Setting up a Rust + WASM environment
2. Building components and wiring signals
3. Rendering with RSX, lists, and conditionals
4. Server-side rendering and hydration
5. Deploying Rust-based PhilJS apps

## Prerequisites

- Basic Rust knowledge (ownership, borrowing, traits)
- Familiarity with web concepts (DOM, HTTP, forms)
- Optional: TypeScript experience for frontend tooling
