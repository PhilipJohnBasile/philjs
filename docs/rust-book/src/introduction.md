# Introduction

Welcome to The PhilJS Rust Book! This book will teach you how to build modern web applications using PhilJS and Rust.

## Why Rust for Web?

Rust brings several advantages to web development:

- **Performance**: Near-native speed via WebAssembly
- **Type Safety**: Catch bugs at compile time
- **Memory Safety**: No null pointer exceptions or data races
- **Ecosystem**: Access to the Rust crate ecosystem

## Why PhilJS?

PhilJS is the only framework that provides:

- **True Dual-Language Support**: Write in Rust OR JavaScript
- **Shared Reactivity**: Signals work across both languages  
- **Best-in-Class SSR**: Streaming, resumability, hydration
- **Familiar Patterns**: If you know SolidJS or Leptos, you know PhilJS

## What You Will Learn

1. Setting up a Rust + WASM development environment
2. Building reactive components with signals
3. Server-side rendering with Axum or Actix
4. Deploying to production

## Prerequisites

- Basic Rust knowledge (ownership, borrowing, traits)
- Familiarity with web development concepts
- Understanding of reactive programming is helpful but not required
