# Introduction

Welcome to the PhilJS Rust Book. This guide shows how to build modern web apps in Rust with PhilJS while keeping PhilJS standards intact (signals-first, local-first, and Nexus-ready).

## Why Rust for PhilJS

- WASM performance for client-side UI
- Memory safety and predictable concurrency
- Strong typing for shared domain models
- Native server integrations with Axum, Actix, and Rocket

## What you will learn

- Set up a Rust + WASM toolchain
- Build components with `view!` and signals
- Render HTML on the server with hydration hooks
- Use server functions and streaming SSR
- Ship to production targets

## Conventions

- Code samples are Rust unless noted
- Node 24+ is required for the frontend toolchain
- Package versions use `0.1.0`
- Commands use `cargo philjs` where possible
