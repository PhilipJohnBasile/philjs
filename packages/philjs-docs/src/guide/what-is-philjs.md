# What is PhilJS?

PhilJS is a universal UI framework that works in both JavaScript/TypeScript and Rust.

## Key Features

- **Fine-grained Reactivity**: Signals-based reactivity with automatic dependency tracking
- **Dual Language**: Write components in TypeScript OR Rust - your choice
- **Streaming SSR**: Progressive server rendering with Suspense
- **Resumability**: Qwik-style zero-hydration for instant interactivity
- **Tiny Bundle**: Core is only 3KB gzipped

## Philosophy

PhilJS takes the best ideas from modern frameworks:
- Signals from SolidJS
- Resumability from Qwik  
- Streaming from React 18
- Rust integration from Leptos
- Islands from Astro

## When to Use PhilJS

- Building high-performance web apps
- Need both JS and Rust in your stack
- Want minimal JavaScript sent to client
- Building content-heavy sites with islands
- Need enterprise-grade SSR with streaming
