## Quick Start Guide

### Prerequisites

```bash
# Install Claude Code
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code

# Verify installation
claude --version
```

### Step 1: Build the PhilJS Framework

```bash
cd ~/projects
mkdir philjs
cd philjs
git init
claude --dangerously-skip-permissions
```

**Then paste the ENTIRE contents of:** `01-build-framework.md`

Estimated time: 6-10 hours  
Estimated cost: $15-30

### Step 2: Build the Documentation Website

```bash
cd ~/projects
mkdir philjs-docs
cd philjs-docs
git init
claude --dangerously-skip-permissions
```

**Then paste the ENTIRE contents of:** `02-build-docs-site.md`

Estimated time: 4-6 hours  
Estimated cost: $10-15

### Step 3: Write All Documentation Content

```bash
cd ~/projects/philjs-docs
claude --dangerously-skip-permissions
```

**Then paste the ENTIRE contents of:** `03-write-documentation-FULL.txt`

This will write 120+ pages, 150,000+ words of complete documentation.

Estimated time: 8-12 hours  
Estimated cost: $25-40

### Step 4: Validate Everything Works

```bash
cd ~/projects/philjs
claude --dangerously-skip-permissions
```

**Then paste the ENTIRE contents of:** `04-validation-testing-FULL.txt`

This will:
- Audit code vs documentation
- Fix all mismatches
- Write 500+ tests
- Verify 100% alignment

Estimated time: 6-10 hours  
Estimated cost: $15-25

## Total Project Estimates

- **Total time:** 24-38 hours of autonomous Claude Code work
- **Total cost:** $65-110 in API costs
- **Result:** Complete, production-ready framework with world-class documentation

## Important Notes

### About `ultrathink`

Each prompt starts with `ultrathink` which gives Claude 31,999 thinking tokens. This helps with:
- Better architecture planning
- Deeper consideration of tradeoffs
- More thoughtful design decisions

**Note:** This only affects planning/thinking, not output length.

### About `--dangerously-skip-permissions`

This flag prevents Claude Code from asking permission for every action. Essential for autonomous work.

**Is it actually dangerous?** Not really for your own projects. Claude won't do anything truly destructive.

### Monitoring Costs

1. Go to https://console.anthropic.com
2. Check your usage dashboard
3. Set spending limits to avoid surprises
4. Each prompt shows estimated costs above

### If Claude Code Stops

Sometimes Claude Code hits limits or needs to pause. If this happens:

1. Review what was built so far
2. Start a new Claude Code session
3. Ask Claude to "continue from where you left off"
4. Provide context about what's already complete

## Pro Tips

1. **Run overnight:** These prompts take hours - start before bed
2. **Use git:** Commit work frequently to save progress
3. **Monitor console:** Check Anthropic Console for usage
4. **Test locally:** Run the code to verify it works
5. **Backup work:** Keep copies of generated code
6. **Start fresh:** Use new Claude Code session for each prompt

## Success Checklist

## Troubleshooting

### "Claude Code not found"
```bash
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
```

### "Permission denied"
Make sure you're using `--dangerously-skip-permissions` flag

### "Rate limit exceeded"
Wait a few minutes - it will resume automatically

### "Out of context"
Start new session, tell Claude to continue from last checkpoint

### Files not created
Check you're in the right directory and used correct command

## Next Steps After Building

2. **Publish to npm:** Publish packages to npm registry
3. **Deploy docs:** Deploy documentation site to Vercel/Netlify
4. **Announce:** Share PhilJS with the community
5. **Iterate:** Gather feedback and improve
